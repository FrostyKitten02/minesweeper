# Minesweeper in java

## Description
- This is and over-engineered version of the classic minesweeper game
- With UI implementation in SWING

## Purpose

- I wanted to make a minesweeper game that independent of ui libraries and to make it as simple as possible to then use in any other UI library, with minimal class implementations needed to make it work
